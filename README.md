# Blind-Reader

A pdf reader that allows a blind person to read documents. The concept is to use the haptic touch on the screen and speak aloud the word on tap. This system provides some smart features e.g., dynamic scrolling, line checking and vibration notification for the line break.<br/>
• The system is built on the Android platform.<br/>
• The smart feature - dynamic scrolling leverages the phone gyroscope reading and can detect tilt. Based on the tilt angle it triggers the scrolling. <br/>
• The app facilitates different functionalities based on single tap, double tap (speak out line number), longer tap (speak out the name of the directory, setting options) on the screen.<br/>
